Aris Company — Finance Dashboard (Prototype)

Files:
- index.html — main dashboard (dark theme) with localStorage-based transactions
- style.css — styles
- app.js — client-side logic (stores data in browser localStorage)

How to use:
1. Unzip and open index.html in your browser (or host on GitHub Pages).
2. The prototype stores transactions in browser localStorage (no server required).
3. Use +Income / -Expense buttons to add transactions. Charts and table update automatically.

This is a client-side prototype intended for testing UI and flows. For production, a backend and secure storage for API keys is required.
